## Demo client using amplication

This is a sample blog built by Amplication and NextJs

I use Amplication as the backend of my blog. That saves a lot of time because I don't need to write any lines of code to setup the CMS. UI is rendered from server side with NextJs ( template from Next.js tutorial. )

View deployment [here](https://amplication-client-demo.vercel.app)

## How to run client

- Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

- Run the project in development

```
npm run dev
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and everything get done!

## How to view dashboard

[Dashboard](https://ckucijpib12919151bs6rwwjg22p-server-vn57etnuya-ue.a.run.app/) is automatically generated by Amplication. You should take a look to known how cool it is.
